/*
 * * Overall Result: You would PASS this interview.
* 
* Here are your ratings:
* 
* Coding Ability: 4/4 You implemented a clean, optimal backtracking solution using the swapping technique. Your code correctly handles the recursive structure, properly creates deep copies for the result, and maintains state correctly with the swap/unswap pattern.
* 
* Problem Solving Ability: 4/4 You immediately recognized this as a backtracking problem and chose the optimal approach. You understood the recursive structure perfectly and implemented an efficient O(n! * n) solution without needing any hints.
* 
* Communication Skills: 4/4 You clearly articulated your approach, explained the algorithm step-by-step, and correctly analyzed both time and space complexity. Your explanations were concise and demonstrated deep understanding.
* 
* Strengths:
* Optimal algorithm choice and implementation
* Perfect complexity analysis (O(n! * n) time and space)
* Clear communication throughout
* No hints needed
* 
* Areas for improvement:
* Consider testing with edge cases like empty arrays
* Remember: Your current test only uses a single character - testing with the full example would strengthen confidence
* 
* You demonstrated excellent technical skills and interview performance. This would be a strong pass in any top-tier tech company interview!

// Hello! Your interview question is below. Write code in this pad just like you would normally â€“ your AI Interviewer will be able to see it.

// # Permutation Enumeration

// A _permutation_ of a list is a list with the same elements but in any order. Finding all permutations means finding all possible orderings of the input elements.

// Given an array of unique characters, `arr`, return all possible permutations, in any order.

// Example 1: arr = ['x', 'y', 'z']
// Output: [['x', 'y', 'z'],
//          ['x', 'z', 'y'],
//          ['y', 'x', 'z'],
//          ['y', 'z', 'x'],
//          ['z', 'x', 'y'],
//          ['z', 'y', 'x']]

// Example 2: arr = ['x']
// Output: [['x']]

// Constraints:

// - The elements in `arr` are unique.
// - The length of `arr` is at most `10`.
