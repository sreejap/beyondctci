/*
 * * You successfully implemented the optimal solution using level-order traversal with depth tracking.  
* Your code is clean, handles edge cases properly, and demonstrates a solid understanding of the problem.  

* Ratings:  

* Coding Ability: 4/4 Your implementation is excellent - clean structure, proper edge case handling with null check, and efficient use of Java collections.  

* Problem-Solving: 4/4 You identified the optimal approach immediately and implemented it correctly without needing algorithmic hints.  

* Communication: 3/4 You explained your approach well and engaged thoughtfully with complexity analysis, though some responses were quite brief.  

* Strengths:  

* Immediately recognized this as a level-order traversal problem  
* Implemented the optimal O(n) time, O(n) space solution  
* Clean, readable code with proper edge case handling  
* Good understanding of the algorithm mechanics when we discussed it  

* Areas for improvement:  

* Could be more verbose in explaining your thought process upfront  
* Consider discussing trade-offs or alternative approaches  

* You demonstrated strong technical skills and would definitely pass a real interview with this performance. Well done!

// # Left View

// Given the root of a binary tree, return its _left view_. The left view is an array with the value of the first node on each layer, ordered from top to bottom.

// Example:

// Input:
//     1
//    / \
//   2   3
//    \   \
//     5   6
//          \
//           7

// Output: [1, 2, 5, 7]

// Constraints:

// - The number of nodes is at most `10^5`
// - Each node has a value between `0` and `10^9`
