// # Balanced Partition

// Given a balanced parentheses string, `s`, a *balanced partition* is a partition of `s` into substrings, each of which is itself balanced. Return the maximum possible number of substrings in a balanced partition.

// ```
// Example: s = "((()))(()())()(()(()))"
// Output: 4. The balanced partition with the most substrings is "((()))", "(()())", "()", "(()(()))".
// ```

// Constraints:
// - The length of s is at most 10^5
// - s consists only of '(' and ')'
