Here’s the **Graph Problem Master List** – the **7 core patterns** that cover **\~80% of interview graph questions**. If you master these, you’ll recognize almost every question as a variation. 🚀

---

## **1️⃣ Connected Components / Counting Problems**

* **Pattern:** DFS or BFS to visit all nodes in each component.
* **Keywords:** “Count islands,” “Number of provinces,” “Connected groups.”
* **Examples:**

  * Count Grid Islands 🌴
  * Number of Provinces (LeetCode 547)
  * Count Components in an Undirected Graph

---

## **2️⃣ Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph**

* **Pattern:** BFS (single-source or multi-source).
* **Keywords:** “Minimum steps,” “Days until all infected,” “Spreading.”
* **Examples:**

  * Days Until All Infected 🦠
  * Rotting Oranges (LeetCode 994)
  * Shortest Path in Binary Matrix (LeetCode 1091)

---

## **3️⃣ Multi-Source BFS (Wave Propagation)**

* **Pattern:** Start BFS with **all sources at once**.
* **Keywords:** “Spread,” “Simultaneous,” “Minimum days.”
* **Examples:**

  * Fire Spread / Zombie Infection
  * Walls and Gates (LeetCode 286)
  * Pacific Atlantic Water Flow 🌊

---

## **4️⃣ DFS with Backtracking (Paths / Combinations)**

* **Pattern:** Explore all paths; backtrack after exploring neighbors.
* **Keywords:** “All paths,” “Find if a word/path exists,” “Generate.”
* **Examples:**

  * Word Search (LeetCode 79)
  * Hamiltonian Path / All Paths in DAG
  * N-Queens or Combination Sum (graph disguised as recursion tree)

---

## **5️⃣ Cycle Detection**

* **Pattern:** DFS with parent tracking (undirected) or color-marking (directed).
* **Keywords:** “Detect loop,” “Check if graph is valid.”
* **Examples:**

  * Course Schedule (LeetCode 207)
  * Detect Cycle in Undirected Graph

---

## **6️⃣ Topological Sort / DAG Problems**

* **Pattern:** Post-order DFS or Kahn’s BFS.
* **Keywords:** “Order,” “Dependency,” “Prerequisite.”
* **Examples:**

  * Course Schedule II (LeetCode 210)
  * Alien Dictionary
  * Project Build Order

---

## **7️⃣ Advanced / Optional Patterns**

* **Dijkstra / BFS on Weighted Graph** → for shortest path with weights.
* **Union-Find (DSU)** → for dynamic connectivity / Kruskal’s MST.
* **Tarjan / Bridges & Articulation Points** → for rare hard graph questions.

---

💡 **Your Progress Right Now:**

* ✅ Pattern 1 (Connected Components) → **Count Grid Islands**
* ✅ Pattern 2 & 3 (BFS / Multi-source BFS) → **Days Until All Infected**

Next natural step is **Pattern 4 (DFS Backtracking / Word Search)** or **Pattern 5 (Cycle Detection)** because they come up a lot at Meta-level interviews.
