// # Ad Campaign Boost

// Imagine that you have a little bookstore. We have an array, `projected_sales`, with the projected number of sales per day in the future.

// We are trying to pick `k` days for an advertising campaign, which we expect to boost the sales on those specific days by at least `20`.

// If we pick the days for the advertising campaign correctly, what is the maximum number of consecutive good days in a row we can get?

// A _good day_ is a day with at least `10` sales.

// Example 1: projected_sales = [5, 0, 20, 0, 5], k = 2
// Output: 3.
// The only good day is day 2. We can boost:
//   - days 0 and 1,
//   - days 1 and 3, or
//   - days 3 and 4.
// For instance, if we boost days 0 and 1, the projected sales become:
// [25, 20, 20, 0, 5], with 3 consecutive good days.

// Example 2: projected_sales = [0, 10, 0, 10], k = 1
// Output: 3. We can boost day 2; boosting day 0 is suboptimal.

// Example 3: projected_sales = [5, 5, 5], k = 3
// Output: 3. We can boost all days to make them good days.

// Constraints:

// - `1 <= k <= len(projected_sales) <= 10^5`
// - `0 <= projected_sales[i] <= 10^3`
