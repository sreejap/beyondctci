// # The Floor Is Lava

// We are given an array, `furniture`, where each element consists of four integer coordinates, `[x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]`, indicating the boundary of a rectangular piece of furniture. The furniture pieces are non-overlapping (they can share an edge or a corner).

// We are playing the game 'the floor is lava,' where we have to reach from the first piece of furniture (the one at index `0` in `furniture`) to the last one without touching the floor, only jumping on furniture. If we can jump at most a distance of `d`, where `d` is an integer, can we win?

// Recall that:

// `distance((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) = sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)`.

// For example, if this is the furniture and `d` is `5`, we can jump from the furniture labeled `0` to the one labeled `4` with the indicated jumps:

// https://iio-beyond-ctci-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/the-floor-is-lava-1.png

// However, if `d` is `4` for the same furniture, we can't do it.

// ```
// Example 1:
// furniture = [
//   [1, 1, 9, 5],
//   [12, 9, 20, 13],
//   [16, 2, 22, 7],
//   [24, 9, 26, 11],
//   [29, 1, 31, 5]
// ]
// d = 5

// Output: True
// See the image above

// Example 2:
// furniture = [
//   [1, 1, 9, 5],
//   [12, 9, 20, 13],
//   [16, 2, 22, 7],
//   [24, 9, 26, 11],
//   [29, 1, 31, 5]
// ]
// d = 4
// Output: False
// See the image above
// ```

// Constraints:

// - `2 <= furniture.length <= 1000`
// - `furniture[i]` is a list of `4` integers
// - `0 <= furniture[i][0] < furniture[i][2] < 10^9`
// - `0 <= furniture[i][1] < furniture[i][3] < 10^9`
// - The furniture pieces are non-overlapping
// - `0 < d <= 10^9`
// - All coordinates and distances are floating-point numbers
