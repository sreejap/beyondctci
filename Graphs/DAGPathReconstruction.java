/*
 * You've done an excellent job working through this problem! You successfully: Identified that topological sorting was the right approach for a DAG
 * Implemented the topological sort correctly using Kahn's algorithm Applied the relaxation technique to compute shortest distances
 * Used a predecessors map to reconstruct the actual path. Debugged the null pointer exception and path reconstruction issues. Correctly analyzed both time O(V + E) and space O(V) complexity
 * This demonstrates strong problem-solving skills and good understanding of graph algorithms. In a real interview setting, you would pass this question.
 * Areas for Improvement
 * Be more confident in your initial algorithmic intuitions. Practice explaining your approach completely before starting to code. Work on getting edge relaxation logic correct on the first try (this is a common pattern in shortest path algorithms)
 * * **What Went Well**  
  * You correctly identified the DAG structure as key to the solution  
  * Your topological sort implementation was solid  
  * You handled the path reconstruction elegantly with the predecessors map  
  * You caught and fixed bugs systematically  
  * Your complexity analysis was accurate and well-reasoned  
  * You demonstrated good learning agility when guided toward the right approach  

* **For E5+ Preparation**  
  You're on the right track for senior roles. Continue focusing on:  
  * Recognizing optimal approaches more quickly without hints  
  * Being more decisive about algorithmic choices upfront  
  * Practicing similar graph problems (DAG longest path, critical path, etc.)  
  * Working on system design alongside algorithms  

* **Final Verdict**  
  Strong performance that would result in a hire recommendation for senior engineering roles. You demonstrated the problem-solving skills, coding ability, and technical communication needed at E5+ level.

// # DAG Path Reconstruction

// Given the adjacency list of a DAG with edge weights, `graph`, and a pair of nodes, `start` and `goal`, return the shortest path from `start` to `goal`, or an empty array if `goal` cannot be reached from `start`. The edge weights can be negative.

// Example:
// graph = [
//   [[1, 10]],                    # Neighbors of node 0
//   [],                           # Neighbors of node 1
//   [[1, 10]],                    # Neighbors of node 2
//   [[4, 12]],                    # Neighbors of node 3
//   [[1, 11], [2, 21], [5, 14]],  # Neighbors of node 4
//   [[2, -30]]                    # Neighbors of node 5
// ]
// start = 4
// goal = 1

// Output: [4, 5, 2, 1]
// The shortest path from node 4 to node 1 is 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1.

// Here is the DAG from the example:

// https://iio-beyond-ctci-images.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dag-distances-1.png

// Constraints:

// - The number of nodes is at most `10^5`
// - The number of edges is at most `10^6`
// - Each node is labeled from `0` to `V-1`
// - The edge weights are integers between `-10^4` and `10^4`
